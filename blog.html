                        <h3>The difference between Margin, Border, and Padding</h3>
                        <h4>Sprint Two Technical Blog | Sunday 22nd November, 2020</h4>

                    <div class="blog-body">
                        <p> The best way to describe the difference between these three properties is to use the box
                            model.
                            In CSS the box model consists of layers that wrap around every HTML element.
                            These layers are: border, padding, margin, and the element itself.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <h5>The Box Model</h5>

                        </figure>
                        <h5>Margin</h5>
                        <p>Specifies the amount of space between the border and the outside edge of the element. Each
                            side of the margin layer can also be specified individually.</p>
                        <img src="blog-images/sprint-2/margin-1.png" alt="Margin" class="margin">
                        <h5>Border</h5>
                        <p> Specifies the amount of space between the padding of the content area and the margin. This
                            property specifies the width of the border along with the border style and colour.</p>
                        <img src="blog-images/sprint-2/border.png" alt="Border" class="border">
                        <h5>Padding</h5>
                        <p>Specifies the amount of space between the content area and the border. Each side of the
                            padding layer can also be specified individually.</p>
                        <img src="blog-images/sprint-2/padding-1.png" alt="Padding" class="padding">
                        <h5>Content</h5>
                        <p> The area of the HTML element itself. The size of the content is specified by width and
                            height.</p>

                        <h5>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h5>
                        <p> My short term goal is to successfully navigate the EDA boot camp and be in a position to
                            apply for Junior Web Development roles. My long term goal would be to use the skills and
                            experience I gain in New Zealand to eventually be able to move to Amsterdam.
                            It is important to me that my career pathway provides me with the opportunity for growth
                            and
                            gives me a purpose where I can make a difference.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself
                            while at EDA?</h5>
                        <p>An area I would like to work on while at EDA is my confidence when communicating or
                            presenting my ideas to others. This is something I found hard while studying Fashion
                            Design and an area I wish to continue to improve in so I can confidently communicate my ideas
                            successfully. </p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>A description of your own strengths and limitations.</h5>
                        <p>I am someone that values integrity, kindness, balance, purpose and growth. My strengths
                            are that I am a hard worker, I am flexible, I bring a creative mindset to my work, and I am
                            ateam player. My limitations are that I am quite self-critical and a bit of a
                            perfectionist which can stop me from progressing a task as I can spend too much time on the little
                            details. </p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in
                            this programme. </h5>
                        <p>I will set clear boundaries between when I am studying and my free time. This will ensure
                            I will not spend too much time perfecting little things and instead use time-boxing to
                            focus on the bigger picture.
                            It will be important for me to practice speaking up about my ideas and work on communicating
                            those to other learners who I may be collaborating with along with the facilitators.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h5>
                        <p>When I require help, after I have tried debugging and searching the internet I will
                            ensure I
                            either ask my peers via slack or asking my facilitator directly.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h5>
                        <p> I expect an open and honest relationship with the facilitators so I can feel fully
                            comfortable to come to them for help and technical support.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h5> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other
                            things.</h5>
                        <p>During Foundations, I will be working two days per week, so I need to plan my week wisely
                            to ensure I complete my work while also having a balance of time not studying or working. I
                            plan to block out ten minutes each day to plan and review my learning, even on the days
                            I am working, just to check in and keep on track with each sprint. </p>
