                        <h5>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h5>
                        <p>HTML defines the content and structure of a webpage. HTML would be the skeleton of a
                            body. The skeleton holds everything together and provides the base to support organs and
                            muscles. HTML creates all the content of a website however it doesn't do very much on its
                            own
                            and it won’t look very nice. This is why CSS is required to style the HTML elements. If HTML
                            is
                            the skeleton, then CSS is the skin. CSS changes the appearance of websites, by defining
                            colour,
                            fonts, layouts etc. The styling is what makes a web page more appealing to look at.</p>

                        <h5>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h5>

                        <p>Control flow is the order in which statements and functions are executed, which is from top
                            to
                            bottom, in the order that they appear. This flow can be broken up by conditional statements
                            and
                            loops.</p>

                        <p>Loops are a way to repeatedly run some code. A condition is required to determine how long
                            the loop will iterate.</p>

                        <h6>Looping statements in JavaScript:</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>For:</b> Allows us to repeatedly run some code until an expression we specify returns
                                false.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>While:</b> Repeats some code until its condition returns false.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Do… While:</b> has its conditional expression at the end, this ensures that the code
                                inside the
                                loop will run at least once.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>An example of control flow and loops in everyday life would be when following a recipe for a
                            banana cake.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
                            <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition</li>
                            <li>Add the mashed banana and mix well.</li>
                            <li>Stir the baking soda into the hot milk and add to the creamed mixture.</li>
                            <li>Sift the dry ingredients together and fold through the creamed mixture.</li>
                            <li>Scoop the mixture into a tin, and bake at 180ºC for 50 minutes or until the cake springs
                                back when lightly touched.</li>
                            <li>Leave in tin for 10 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool. When cold, ice
                                with
                                Chocolate Icing or dust with icing sugar.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This recipe is an example of control flow where you must complete each task from top to
                            bottom.
                            For each step there are tasks that are repeated until a condition has been met.</p>

                        <h5>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h5>
                        <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is a hierarchical structure that the browser uses to make
                            sense of a document. Everything that makes up the DOM are known as nodes. The nodes of every
                            document are organized in a tree structure. It is the way through which Javascript can
                            access and modify elements of a HTML document.</p>

                        <h5>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h5>

                        <h6>Arrays</h6>
                        <p>An array stores several pieces of data in one place. Numbers are assigned to each item inside
                            an
                            array starting with zero. These index values are used to access data from an array.</p>
                        <img src="blog-images/sprint-3/array-example.png" alt="Array example">

                        <h6>Objects</h6>
                        <p>An object is a collection of properties. Each property is a variable with a name and a value.
                            Dot notation or bracket notation is used to access properties of an object by using the
                            object
                            name and property name.</p>
                        <img src="blog-images/sprint-3/object1-example.png" alt="Object example" id="object">
                        <p>Dot notation:</p>
                        <img src="blog-images/sprint-3/object2-example.png" alt="dot notation example">

                        <img src="blog-images/sprint-3/object3-example.png" alt="bracket notation example">
                        <p>If a property name has a space you must use bracket notation to access the property.</p>

                        <p>Accessing nested properties:</p>
                        <img src="blog-images/sprint-3/object4-example.png" alt="nested example">
                       
                       <h5>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h5> 

                        <p>A function is a set of reusable statements which perform a particular task.</p>

                        <p>A function declaration consists of the function keyword, the name of the function, a list of
                        parameters in parentheses and separated by commas, and enclosed in curly brackets the function
                        statements. Defining the function doesn't execute the function it only names the function and
                        specifies what to do when the function is called. Calling the function is what actually invokes
                        the specified action and includes parameters.</p>

                        <p>Functions are important as it enables you to quickly and easily reuse code. Once the function is
                        defined, it can be called many times including with different arguments (parameters) to produce
                        different results.</p>

                        <h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>
                        <h4>Sprint Three Cultural Blog | Tuesday 24th November, 2020</h4>

                        <hr>

                    <div class="blog-body">
                        <h5>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h5>
                        <p>Emotional intelligence (EI) or Emotional Quotient (EQ) is being aware of your own emotions
                            and
                            being able to identify and manage them. It is also about being aware of how those emotions
                            affect those around you along with an awareness for how others are feeling.</p>
                        <p>The four attributes of emotional intelligence are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Self-management</li>
                            <li>Self-awareness</li>
                            <li>Social awareness</li>
                            <li>Relationship management</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h5>How is it different to IQ?</h5>
                        <p>Intelligence quotient (IQ) is a number to express a person's intelligence relative to their
                            age.
                            It is a measure of a person’s reasoning ability and how they use logic to answer a question
                            or
                            solve a problem. IQ can also be used to define an individual's knowledge and proficiency of
                            a
                            specific topic.</p>

                        <h5>Why is emotional intelligence important?</h5>
                        <p>EQ is important as it allows you to communicate effectively and work productively
                            with
                            others. It also also allows you to adapt to change and challenges when they arise more
                            easily.</p>

                        <h3>The difference between Margin, Border, and Padding</h3>
                        <h4>Sprint Two Technical Blog | Sunday 22nd November, 2020</h4>

                        <p> The best way to describe the difference between these three properties is to use the box
                            model.
                            In CSS the box model consists of layers that wrap around every HTML element.
                            These layers are: border, padding, margin, and the element itself.</p>
                        <figure>

                        <h5>Margin</h5>
                        <p>Specifies the amount of space between the border and the outside edge of the element. Each
                            side of the margin layer can also be specified individually.</p>
                        <img src="blog-images/sprint-2/margin-1.png" alt="Margin" class="margin">
                        <h5>Border</h5>
                        <p> Specifies the amount of space between the padding of the content area and the margin. This
                            property specifies the width of the border along with the border style and colour.</p>
                        <img src="blog-images/sprint-2/border.png" alt="Border" class="border">
                        <h5>Padding</h5>
                        <p>Specifies the amount of space between the content area and the border. Each side of the
                            padding layer can also be specified individually.</p>

                            presenting my ideas to others. This is something I found hard while studying Fashion
                            Design and an area I wish to continue to improve in so I can confidently communicate my
                            ideas
                            successfully. </p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>A description of your own strengths and limitations.</h5>
                        <p>I am someone that values integrity, kindness, balance, purpose and growth. My strengths
                            are that I am a hard worker, I am flexible, I bring a creative mindset to my work, and I am
                            ateam player. My limitations are that I am quite self-critical and a bit of a
                            perfectionist which can stop me from progressing a task as I can spend too much time on the
                            little
                            details. </p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in
                            this programme. </h5>
                        <p>I will set clear boundaries between when I am studying and my free time. This will ensure
                            I will not spend too much time perfecting little things and instead use time-boxing to
                            focus on the bigger picture.
                            It will be important for me to practice speaking up about my ideas and work on communicating
                            those to other learners who I may be collaborating with along with the facilitators.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h5>
                        <p>When I require help, after I have tried debugging and searching the internet I will
                            ensure I
                            either ask my peers via slack or asking my facilitator directly.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h5>
                        <p> I expect an open and honest relationship with the facilitators so I can feel fully
                            comfortable to come to them for help and technical support.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h5> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other
                            things.</h5>
                        <p>During Foundations, I will be working two days per week, so I need to plan my week wisely
                            to ensure I complete my work while also having a balance of time not studying or working. I
                            plan to block out ten minutes each day to plan and review my learning, even on the days
                            I am working, just to check in and keep on track with each sprint. </p>

                        <h5>Describe your core personal values.</h5>
                        <p> This year has been a year of reflection for me with my plans having to change so much. I
                            have
                            used this year to take a step back and reflect on my personal values and my goals for the
                            future. I would summarize my core personal values as integrity, balance, kindness, purpose,
                            and
                            growth.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Integrity is an important part of my identity as I value honesty and staying true to
                                myself.</li>

                            <li>It is important to me to treat everyone with kindness and compassion even when I do not
                                agree, I
                                still find it important to try and understand their situation.</li>

                            <li>I am always striving to create balance in my life between approaching life with
                                structure vs.
                                being flexible and adapting to changes.</li>

                            <li> I highly value having a purpose and making a difference in my own way. I believe that
                                everyone
                                can make a difference in their lifetime no matter how small or big the effect may be.
                            </li>

                            <li>I value growth, professionally and personally. I have found I get the most joy and
                                engagement
                                out of a job when I can continue to learn and I am being challenged to improve myself
                                and my
                                outcomes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h5>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed
                            up
                            the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the
                            action
                            you took.</h5>

                        <p>Having worked in the fashion industry which is known as one of the most polluting industries
                            in
                            the world along with a lot of questionable ethical practices I have spent a lot of time
                            researching these issues. With the knowledge of how much of an impact unsustainable and
                            unethical fashion has made my decisions when consuming fashion an ethical one. One of the
                            big ethical decisions is the choice between the use of leather vs. faux leather shoes. </p>
                        <p> With leather, the pros are that it is a long-lasting and hard-wearing product that will last
                            a long time plus it is a by-product of the meat industry and will eventually decompose. The
                            cons are that most leather is tanned using high levels of toxic chemicals, there is
                            potential
                            animal cruelty in the supply chain and the leather trade is contributing to the
                            deforestation of
                            theamazon.</p>
                        <p>But then we look at the alternative which is faux leather which is a plastic-based synthetic
                            material. The pros are that there is no animal cruelty involved in the supply chain, and it
                            is durable. The cons are that it is another plastic product which will not decompose, and
                            also contains harmful chemicals.</p>
                        <p>So how do I decide between real and faux leather after knowing all the facts?
                            My decision is only to buy leather if I am sourcing my shoes from a company who is doing
                            their best to minimise their impact. For example, some companies are choosing to use
                            vegetable tanning, who are ensuring that they do not contribute to deforestation and are
                            ethically
                            sourced. So when I do decide to buy a leather product I do my research and I make sure that
                            I care for my shoes so they last for as long as possible.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h5>
                        <p>I find it hard to pinpoint exactly how my culture has influenced my values and identity as a
                            Pakeha New Zealander. However, my values and identity have been strongly influenced by my
                            family. I grew up with my mum teaching music in the house along with my dad working at home
                            as
                            an Architect. I believe being surrounded by this creativity and having a front-row seat into
                            my
                            parents' careers has given me the understanding of hard work, adaptability and a willingness
                            to
                            follow a career path that is less traditional and to instead find a path that I am
                            passionate
                            about, that makes me feel like I can make a difference.</p>

                        <h5>Describe your strengths and limitations.</h5>
                        <p>My strengths are that I am a hard worker, I am flexible, I bring a creative mindset to my
                            work,
                            I am a team player and I am always open to new experiences and learning new skills. My
                            limitations are that I am quite self-critical and a bit of a perfectionist which can prevent
                            me
                            from moving on from a task or result in spending too much time on the little details. I also
                            need to work having confidence in my ideas and communicating my ideas and work to others
                            effectively.</p>

                        <h5>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.
                        </h5>
                        <p>My flexibility, my willingness to give any task a try or help anyone else out has been an
                            asset
                            to my previous career in fashion and will be something I bring into my new career path.
                            I have found that my desire to be learning new skills and having variety in my work has
                            resulted
                            in outgrowing my roles but I have been held back being self-critical and having a lack of
                            opportunities in the industry. Being very self-critical and trying to perfect my work has
                            gotten
                            in the way of my learning in the past.</p>

                        <h5>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might
                            intersect with learning obstacles.</h5>
                        <p>I believe all my strengths will aid me in succeeding in my learning journey at EDA. I can use
                            my
                            flexibility, perseverance and creative mindset to overcome obstacles and problem solve.
                            Being a
                            team player will be helpful while completing group tasks. The obstacles I will encounter
                            will be
                            self-doubt and self-criticism which might tell me my work isn't good enough or I won't be
                            smart
                            enough to complete the bootcamp and become a web developer.</p>

                        <h5>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with
                            others,
                            but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how
                            effective
                            they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h5>

                        <p>I was working in a team and we had a deadline to meet. Each team member had tasks to complete
                            along the chain. I had completed as much work as I could and was awaiting more work from a
                            colleague who had a lot of work to do and was overwhelmed. I offered to help in any way I
                            could,
                            however, they declined. This resistance my colleague had to give up control of their work by
                            allowing me to help was frustrating as I could have easily helped to lighten my colleagues'
                            workload and ultimately meet our deadline sooner. The way I dealt with this situation was by
                            waiting to approach my colleague when they were not in a position of stress. I then asked to
                            be
                            shown how they complete their tasks. This meant the next time we needed to meet a deadline I
                            was
                            able to offer my colleague help, my colleague felt comfortable in sharing their work, and we
                            were more productive as a team.</p>
