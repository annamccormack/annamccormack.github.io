                        <h4>Sprint Five Cultural Blog | Thursday 10 December, 2020</h4>
                        <hr>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-body">
                        <h5>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the
                            core learning?</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I have learnt that I had been stuck in a fixed mindset when it came to learning during
                                my previous period of study but when it comes to learning about Web Development I have
                                fully embraced the growth mindset and open to failing in order to grow and learn. </li>
                            <li>I have learnt to reflect on my values and understand what is important to me and what
                                drives me to learn. </li>
                            <li>I have learnt that I can communicate my ideas effectively, I just need to spend some
                                time considering what I am going to say before I speak.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h5>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h5>
                        <p>
                            I think being self-aware of your values, strengths and limitations makes you a better
                            learner.
                            Self-awareness, empathy and understanding your values are all important aspects of your
                            Emotional Intelligence. If you can understand and manage your feelings you can learn better
                            and if you can empathise with others you can work with others more effectively.
                        </p>
                        <h5>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h5>
                        <p>
                            I think what surprised me the most was that what I learnt from the core learning actually
                            resulted
                            in being a better learner.
                        </p>
                        <h5>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h5>
                        <p>
                            I found having to summarize myself and my ideas in the blog posts the most challenging
                            aspect of the core learning.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core
                            learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h5>
                        <p>
                            Core learning has taught me that EQ is just as important as IQ. So by spending time learning
                            about these core subjects, we as students improve our EQ. Increased EQ means we are better
                            at working with others, are more employable and better programmers.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you
                            have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h5>
                        <p>
                            Spending time on core leaning has not been a waste of time. In some ways, I have found the
                            core work harder than the technical as It has made me reflect on myself and summarise this
                            for each cultural blog. I think my understanding of things like EQ, problem-solving
                            techniques, neuroplasticity and the growth mindset has improved how I learn and problem
                            solve.

                        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
                        <h4>Sprint Four Technical Blog | Saturday 5th December, 2020</h4>
                        <hr>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-body">
                        <h5>A time when I got blocked on a simple problem.</h5>
                        <p>
                            During the Built-in Methods kata, I found I got stuck on the deBee function. I had written
                            my pseudocode for the function and researched what in-built methods I needed to use, but all
                            my failed attempts kept on telling me that the .find method did not exist. With some
                            googling, and trying the rubber ducky method by talking to my fern plant, I figured how to
                            combine all the in-built methods correctly. Yet, the function was still not passing the
                            tests! Why?! I had simply forgotten to include the brackets ( ) at the end of the
                            .toLowerCase() method. This challenge taught me the importance of checking for spelling and
                            syntax mistakes and using the error messages to help me solve the problem.
                        </p>
                        <h5>A time when I solved a problem in an elegant way</h5>
                        <p>
                            During the kata challenges this week, I felt like I was able to solve the JS Olympics
                            challenges quite elegantly. I was on a roll from all the previous kata challenges and
                            felt quite confident in my problem-solving abilities after successfully working
                            through all the previous problems. I learnt that using pseudocode is a helpful tool
                            for planning my solution before writing any code.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Reflecting on my confidence in using problem-solving techniques and processes.</h5>
                        <br>
                        <h6>Pseudocode</h6>
                        <p>
                            Is not actual code, but is non-technical steps, written plainly that create the rough draft
                            of your code. I have found pseudocode a very important step in my problem-solving process,
                            and one of the first steps I take when planning my code. It allows me to break down the
                            large challenge into smaller manageable tasks and to have a greater understanding of what my
                            code will do.
                        </p>
                        <h6>Trying something</h6>
                        <p>
                            By simply attempting something you have started to solve the problem because if it works
                            then great and if it doesn't then it is a starting point from where you can apply other
                            problem-solving techniques. By giving the code a try you will get error messages that may
                            help you figure out what you have done wrong and may lead to questions that can be answered
                            by researching further.
                        </p>
                        <h6>Reading error messages</h6>
                        <p>
                            When an error occurs, JavaScript will normally stop, and generate an error message. Reading
                            these error messages can be a very useful way to debug your code. The error message provides
                            the location/ line of the error and the type of error. Some examples of errors messages
                            include Syntax errors, Expected or unexpected parenthesis and brackets, X Is Not defined:
                            when a variable has not been defined. I have found reading through error messages great at
                            pinpointing why my code is not working.
                        </p>
                        <h6>The Rubber Ducky Method</h6>
                        <p>
                            Is a method of debugging code. It involves explaining the problem to an inanimate object
                            like a rubber duck. Typically in the process of doing this, you’ll find your problem.
                            <!-- (insert meme)  -->
                            I don't have a rubber duck but I have tried discussing my problems out loud to my
                            houseplants. I do feel a little silly and have had mixed results from this technique.
                        </p>
                        <h6>Console.logging</h6>
                        <p>
                            console.log() is a function that writes a message to log on the console. This is a useful
                            way to test sections of code to see if they are functioning.
                        </p>
                        <h6>Googling</h6>
                        <p>
                            Google is a great tool as it can provide you with the knowledge you need. Any problem you
                            have when coding, someone else has had before or has the answer. Keeping to concise and
                            simple questions when googling can find these answers quickly. I found myself using google a
                            lot during the kata challenges, for finding out about methods or getting past a problem,
                            googling has been a very helpful tool.
                        </p>
                        <h6>Asking your peers and coaches for help</h6>
                        <p>
                            I haven't had any many instances during the foundations of needing to ask for help from
                            peers or coaches but when I do need that help I am comfortable to do so.
                        </p>
                        <h6>Reflection</h6>
                        <p class="quote">
                            "We do not learn from experience ... we learn from reflecting on experience." | John Dewey
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have found using reflection as a great way to improve my process. Reflecting at the end of
                            a task means I understand what I have learnt and ensures I have met the learning
                            competencies and identifies areas I may need to work on.
                            I have gotten into the habit of starting each day of study with these four questions:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What are my goals today?</li>
                            <li>What are my challenges today?</li>
                            <li>Have I reached my goals for today?</li>
                            <li>What have I learnt today?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Neuroplasticity</h5>
                        <p>
                            Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to adapt to new situations and is the process
                            by
                            which all permanent learning takes place in your brain. Every time we learn something new,
                            we are
                            harnessing the power of neuroplasticity. When you repeatedly practise an activity or access
                            a
                            memory the neural pathways of the brain are changed, these connections are constantly
                            becoming
                            stronger or weaker according to our experiences. Repeated thinking, feeling and doing
                            strengthens a pathway and makes it easier to follow this pathway. When we stop practising,
                            the
                            brain will eventually eliminate the cells that formed the pathways. Its like any other
                            muscle in
                            our body, if you don't use it, you lose it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Understanding how neuroplasticity works gives us the knowledge that we can learn and change
                            our
                            way of thinking and that our abilities are not fixed and can be improved on through
                            repetition.
                        </p>
                        <h6>How to improve neuroplasticity:</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Quality sleep.</li>

                        <h5>Growth Mindset</h5>
                        <p>
                            The growth mindset is the understanding that your abilities can be developed through
                            sustained
                            effort. Whereas, a fixed mindset is the belief that your intelligence and abilities are
                            fixed.
                            So when conflicts arise a fixed mindset usually results in avoidance due to the fear of
                            failure.
                            When you embrace the growth mindset, problems can be seen as opportunities to learn and
                            constructive criticism can be seen as an opportunity to improve. This mindset uses effort
                            and
                            difficulty to create growth and puts importance on trying instead of the final outcome. It
                            is
                            also important to note that we may have a growth mindset in one area and a fixed mindset in
                            another.
                        </p>
                        <h6>A few ways to embrace the growth mindset are:</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>View challenges as opportunities.</li>
                            <li>Replace failure with learning.</li>
                            <li>Value the process over the final outcome.</li>
                            <li>Utilise the knowledge of neuroplasticity and practice practice practice.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>The DOM, HTML vs CSS, Javascript</h3>
                        <h4>Sprint Three Technical Blog | Sunday 29th November, 2020</h4>

                        <h5>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS.</h5>
                        <p>
                            HTML defines the content and structure of a webpage. HTML would be the skeleton of a
                            body. The skeleton holds everything together and provides the base to support organs and
                            muscles. HTML creates all the content of a website however it doesn't do very much on its
                            own
                            and it won’t look very nice. This is why CSS is required to style the HTML elements. If HTML
                            is
                            the skeleton, then CSS is the skin. CSS changes the appearance of websites, by defining
                            colour,
                            fonts, layouts etc. The styling is what makes a web page more appealing to look at.

                        <h5>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h5>

                        <p>
                            Control flow is the order in which statements and functions are executed, which is from top
                            to
                            bottom, in the order that they appear. This flow can be broken up by conditional statements
                            and
                            loops.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Loops are a way to repeatedly run some code. A condition is required to determine how long
                            the loop will iterate.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Looping statements in JavaScript:</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>For:</b> Allows us to repeatedly run some code until an expression we specify returns
                                false.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>While:</b> Repeats some code until its condition returns false.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Do… While:</b> has its conditional expression at the end, this ensures that the code
                                inside the
                                loop will run at least once.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            An example of control flow and loops in everyday life would be when following a recipe for a
                            banana cake.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
                            <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition</li>
                            <li>Add the mashed banana and mix well.</li>
                            <li>Stir the baking soda into the hot milk and add to the creamed mixture.</li>
                            <li>Sift the dry ingredients together and fold through the creamed mixture.</li>
                            <li>Scoop the mixture into a tin, and bake at 180ºC for 50 minutes or until the cake springs
                                back when lightly touched.</li>
                            <li>Leave in tin for 10 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool. When cold, ice
                                with Chocolate Icing or dust with icing sugar.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This recipe is an example of control flow where you must complete each task from top to
                            bottom.
                            For each step there are tasks that are repeated until a condition has been met.</p>

                        <h5>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h5>
                        <p>
                            The DOM (Document Object Model) is a hierarchical structure that the browser uses to make
                            sense of a document. Everything that makes up the DOM are known as nodes. The nodes of every
                            document are organized in a tree structure. It is the way through which Javascript can
                            access and modify elements of a HTML document.

                        <h6>Arrays</h6>
                        <p>
                            An array stores several pieces of data in one place. Numbers are assigned to each item
                            inside
                            an
                            array starting with zero. These index values are used to access data from an array.
                        </p>
                        <img src="blog-images/sprint-3/array-example.png" alt="Array example">

                        <h6>Objects</h6>
                        <p>
                            An object is a collection of properties. Each property is a variable with a name and a
                            value.
                            Dot notation or bracket notation is used to access properties of an object by using the
                            object
                            name and property name.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If a property name has a space you must use bracket notation to access the property.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h5>

                        <p>
                            A function is a set of reusable statements which perform a particular task.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A function declaration consists of the function keyword, the name of the function, a list of
                            parameters in parentheses and separated by commas, and enclosed in curly brackets the
                            function
                            statements. Defining the function doesn't execute the function it only names the function
                            and
                            specifies what to do when the function is called. Calling the function is what actually
                            invokes
                            the specified action and includes parameters.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Functions are important as it enables you to quickly and easily reuse code. Once the
                            function
                            is
                            defined, it can be called many times including with different arguments (parameters) to
                            produce
                            different results.

                        <p>
                            Emotional intelligence (EI) or Emotional Quotient (EQ) is being aware of your own emotions
                            and
                            being able to identify and manage them. It is also about being aware of how those emotions
                            affect those around you along with an awareness for how others are feeling.

                        <h5>How is it different to IQ?</h5>
                        <p>
                            Intelligence quotient (IQ) is a number to express a person's intelligence relative to their
                            age. It is a measure of a person’s reasoning ability and how they use logic to
                            answer a question or solve a problem. IQ can also be used to define an individual's
                            knowledge and proficiency of a specific topic.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Why is emotional intelligence important?</h5>
                        <p>
                            EQ is important as it allows you to communicate effectively and work productively
                            with others. It also also allows you to adapt to change and challenges when they
                            arise more easily.

                            The best way to describe the difference between these three properties is to use the box
                            model.
                            In CSS the box model consists of layers that wrap around every HTML element.
                            These layers are: border, padding, margin, and the element itself.

                            Specifies the amount of space between the border and the outside edge of the element. Each
                            side of the margin layer can also be specified individually.

                        <p>
                            My short term goal is to successfully navigate the EDA boot camp and be in a position to
                            apply for Junior Web Development roles. My long term goal would be to use the skills and
                            experience I gain in New Zealand to eventually be able to move to Amsterdam.
                            It is important to me that my career pathway provides me with the opportunity for growth
                            and
                            gives me a purpose where I can make a difference.

                            while at EDA?</h5>
                        <p>
                            An area I would like to work on while at EDA is my confidence when communicating or
                            presenting my ideas to others. This is something I found hard while studying Fashion
                            Design and an area I wish to continue to improve in so I can confidently communicate my
                            ideas successfully.

                        <p>
                            I am someone that values integrity, kindness, balance, purpose and growth. My strengths
                            are that I am a hard worker, I am flexible, I bring a creative mindset to my work, and I am
                            ateam player. My limitations are that I am quite self-critical and a bit of a
                            perfectionist which can stop me from progressing a task as I can spend too much time on the
                            little
                            details.

                            this programme. </h5>
                        <p>
                            I will set clear boundaries between when I am studying and my free time. This will ensure
                            I will not spend too much time perfecting little things and instead use time-boxing to
                            focus on the bigger picture.
                            It will be important for me to practice speaking up about my ideas and work on communicating
                            those to other learners who I may be collaborating with along with the facilitators.

                            When I require help, after I have tried debugging and searching the internet I will
                            ensure I
                            either ask my peers via slack or asking my facilitator directly.

                            I expect an open and honest relationship with the facilitators so I can feel fully
                            comfortable to come to them for help and technical support.

                            During Foundations, I will be working two days per week, so I need to plan my week wisely
                            to ensure I complete my work while also having a balance of time not studying or working. I
                            plan to block out ten minutes each day to plan and review my learning, even on the days
                            I am working, just to check in and keep on track with each sprint.

                        <h5>Describe your core personal values.</h5>
                        <p>
                            This year has been a year of reflection for me with my plans having to change so much. I
                            have
                            used this year to take a step back and reflect on my personal values and my goals for the
                            future. I would summarize my core personal values as integrity, balance, kindness, purpose,
                            and
                            growth.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Integrity is an important part of my identity as I value honesty and staying true to
                                myself.</li>

                            <li>It is important to me to treat everyone with kindness and compassion even when I do not
                                agree, I
                                still find it important to try and understand their situation.</li>

                            <li>I am always striving to create balance in my life between approaching life with
                                structure vs.
                                being flexible and adapting to changes.</li>

                            <li> I highly value having a purpose and making a difference in my own way. I believe that
                                everyone
                                can make a difference in their lifetime no matter how small or big the effect may be.
                            </li>

                            <li>I value growth, professionally and personally. I have found I get the most joy and
                                engagement
                                out of a job when I can continue to learn and I am being challenged to improve myself
                                and my
                                outcomes.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed
                            up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences

                        <p>
                            Having worked in the fashion industry which is known as one of the most polluting industries
                            in
                            the world along with a lot of questionable ethical practices I have spent a lot of time
                            researching these issues. With the knowledge of how much of an impact unsustainable and
                            unethical fashion has made my decisions when consuming fashion an ethical one. One of the
                            big ethical decisions is the choice between the use of leather vs. faux leather shoes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With leather, the pros are that it is a long-lasting and hard-wearing product that will last
                            a long time plus it is a by-product of the meat industry and will eventually decompose. The
                            cons are that most leather is tanned using high levels of toxic chemicals, there is
                            potential
                            animal cruelty in the supply chain and the leather trade is contributing to the
                            deforestation of
                            theamazon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But then we look at the alternative which is faux leather which is a plastic-based synthetic
                            material. The pros are that there is no animal cruelty involved in the supply chain, and it
                            is durable. The cons are that it is another plastic product which will not decompose, and
                            also contains harmful chemicals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So how do I decide between real and faux leather after knowing all the facts?
                            My decision is only to buy leather if I am sourcing my shoes from a company who is doing
                            their best to minimise their impact. For example, some companies are choosing to use
                            vegetable tanning, who are ensuring that they do not contribute to deforestation and are
                            ethically
                            sourced. So when I do decide to buy a leather product I do my research and I make sure that
                            I care for my shoes so they last for as long as possible.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h5>
                        <p>
                            I find it hard to pinpoint exactly how my culture has influenced my values and identity as a
                            Pakeha New Zealander. However, my values and identity have been strongly influenced by my
                            family. I grew up with my mum teaching music in the house along with my dad working at home
                            as
                            an Architect. I believe being surrounded by this creativity and having a front-row seat into
                            my
                            parents' careers has given me the understanding of hard work, adaptability and a willingness
                            to
                            follow a career path that is less traditional and to instead find a path that I am
                            passionate
                            about, that makes me feel like I can make a difference.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Describe your strengths and limitations.</h5>
                        <p>
                            My strengths are that I am a hard worker, I am flexible, I bring a creative mindset to my
                            work,
                            I am a team player and I am always open to new experiences and learning new skills. My
                            limitations are that I am quite self-critical and a bit of a perfectionist which can prevent
                            me
                            from moving on from a task or result in spending too much time on the little details. I also
                            need to work having confidence in my ideas and communicating my ideas and work to others
                            effectively.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            My flexibility, my willingness to give any task a try or help anyone else out has been an
                            asset
                            to my previous career in fashion and will be something I bring into my new career path.
                            I have found that my desire to be learning new skills and having variety in my work has
                            resulted
                            in outgrowing my roles but I have been held back being self-critical and having a lack of
                            opportunities in the industry. Being very self-critical and trying to perfect my work has
                            gotten
                            in the way of my learning in the past.

                            I believe all my strengths will aid me in succeeding in my learning journey at EDA. I can
                            use
                            my
                            flexibility, perseverance and creative mindset to overcome obstacles and problem solve.
                            Being a
                            team player will be helpful while completing group tasks. The obstacles I will encounter
                            will be
                            self-doubt and self-criticism which might tell me my work isn't good enough or I won't be
                            smart
                            enough to complete the bootcamp and become a web developer.

                            I was working in a team and we had a deadline to meet. Each team member had tasks to
                            complete
                            along the chain. I had completed as much work as I could and was awaiting more work from a
                            colleague who had a lot of work to do and was overwhelmed. I offered to help in any way I
                            could,
                            however, they declined. This resistance my colleague had to give up control of their work by
                            allowing me to help was frustrating as I could have easily helped to lighten my colleagues'
                            workload and ultimately meet our deadline sooner. The way I dealt with this situation was by
                            waiting to approach my colleague when they were not in a position of stress. I then asked to
                            be
                            shown how they complete their tasks. This meant the next time we needed to meet a deadline I
                            was
                            able to offer my colleague help, my colleague felt comfortable in sharing their work, and we
                            were more productive as a team.
