            <h5>Neuroplasticity</h5>
            <p>
                Neuroplasticity refers to the brainâ€™s ability to adapt to new situations and is the process
                by
                which all permanent learning takes place in your brain. Every time we learn something new,
                we are
                harnessing the power of neuroplasticity. When you repeatedly practise an activity or access
                a
                memory the neural pathways of the brain are changed, these connections are constantly
                becoming
                stronger or weaker according to our experiences. Repeated thinking, feeling and doing
                strengthens a pathway and makes it easier to follow this pathway. When we stop practising,
                the
                brain will eventually eliminate the cells that formed the pathways. Its like any other
                muscle in
                our body, if you don't use it, you lose it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Understanding how neuroplasticity works gives us the knowledge that we can learn and change
                our
                way of thinking and that our abilities are not fixed and can be improved on through
                repetition.
            </p>
            <h6>How to improve neuroplasticity:</h6>
            <ul>
                <li> Quality sleep.</li>
                <li>Learning something new.</li>
                <li>Regular exercise.</li>
                <li>Reduce stress through mindfulness.</li>
                <li>Find a purpose for why you are learning</li>
                <li>Read a novel.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Growth Mindset</h5>
            <p>
                The growth mindset is the understanding that your abilities can be developed through
                sustained
                effort. Whereas, a fixed mindset is the belief that your intelligence and abilities are
                fixed.
                So when conflicts arise a fixed mindset usually results in avoidance due to the fear of
                failure.
                When you embrace the growth mindset, problems can be seen as opportunities to learn and
                constructive criticism can be seen as an opportunity to improve. This mindset uses effort
                and
                difficulty to create growth and puts importance on trying instead of the final outcome. It
                is
                also important to note that we may have a growth mindset in one area and a fixed mindset in
                another.
            </p>
            <h6>A few ways to embrace the growth mindset are:</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>View challenges as opportunities.</li>
                <li>Replace failure with learning.</li>
                <li>Value the process over the final outcome.</li>
                <li>Utilise the knowledge of neuroplasticity and practice practice practice.</li>
            </ul>
