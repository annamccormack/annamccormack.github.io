            <h5 class="heading">Reflecting on foundations</h5>
            <br>
            <h5>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the
                core learning?</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>I have learnt that I had been stuck in a fixed mindset when it came to learning during
                    my previous period of study but when it comes to learning about Web Development I have
                    fully embraced the growth mindset and open to failing in order to grow and learn. </li>
                <li>I have learnt to reflect on my values and understand what is important to me and what
                    drives me to learn. </li>
                <li>I have learnt that I can communicate my ideas effectively, I just need to spend some
                    time considering what I am going to say before I speak.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h5>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h5>
            <p>
                I think being self-aware of your values, strengths and limitations makes you a better
                learner.
                Self-awareness, empathy and understanding your values are all important aspects of your
                Emotional Intelligence. If you can understand and manage your feelings you can learn better
                and if you can empathise with others you can work with others more effectively.
            </p>
            <h5>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h5>
            <p>
                I think what surprised me the most was that what I learnt from the core learning actually
                resulted
                in being a better learner.
            </p>
            <h5>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h5>
            <p>
                I found having to summarize myself and my ideas in the blog posts the most challenging
                aspect of the core learning.
            </p>
            <h5>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core
                learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h5>
            <p>
                Core learning has taught me that EQ is just as important as IQ. So by spending time learning
                about these core subjects, we as students improve our EQ. Increased EQ means we are better
                at working with others, are more employable and better programmers.
            </p>
            <h5>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you
                have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h5>
            <p>
                Spending time on core leaning has not been a waste of time. In some ways, I have found the
                core work harder than the technical as It has made me reflect on myself and summarise this
                for each cultural blog. I think my understanding of things like EQ, problem-solving
                techniques, neuroplasticity and the growth mindset has improved how I learn and problem
                solve.

            <h5 class="heading">Preparing for Bootcamp</h5>
            <br>
            <h5>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h5>
            <p>
                My short term goal is to finish the EDA Bootcamp and I am hoping to be able to use the
                skills I gain at EDA to successfully get a Junior Web Development role. I think I would aim
                for a front-end focussed role since I am coming from a design background.
            </p>
            <p>
                My long term goals include: Finding opportunities to combine web development with my
                experience in the fashion industry, travelling and be able to work in web development while
                overseas.
                A big part of choosing web development is that I value personal growth and having a purpose,
                and making a difference. So I hope to work in an organisation that would be making some kind
                of difference.
            </p>
            <h5>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h5>
            <p>
                My strengths of flexibility and being hardworking, and a team player will definitely aid me
                in my learning in bootcamp. Being self-critical and a bit of a perfectionist will continue
                to be a limitation that I need to work past. I can be a little reserved when I first meet
                people, so It will be important that I don't feel too shy to ask for help or contribute to
                team projects early on in bootcamp.
            </p>
            <h5>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h5>
            <p>
                Speaking or presenting my ideas in front of a group. Also staying on top of all the work and
                maintaining momentum over the whole nine weeks.
            </p>
            <h5>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while
                at EDA?</h5>
            <p>
                I would like to strengthen my communication skills, along with my confidence in presenting
                my ideas. I would also like to improve my active listening skills.
            </p>
            <h5>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h5>
            <p>
                My expectation for myself is to attempt to bring a growth mindset to every challenge I face
                and to remind myself of taking the just in time approach.
                I commit to making a plan for each week of bootcamp so that I can manage and keep on top of
                the workload. This plan will include time for reflection, mindfulness, exercise and
                relaxation so that I can have some balance between studying and self care.
