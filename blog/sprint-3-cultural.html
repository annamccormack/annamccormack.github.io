            <h5>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h5>
            <p>
                Emotional intelligence (EI) or Emotional Quotient (EQ) is being aware of your own emotions
                and
                being able to identify and manage them. It is also about being aware of how those emotions
                affect those around you along with an awareness for how others are feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
                The four attributes of emotional intelligence are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Self-management</li>
                <li>Self-awareness</li>
                <li>Social awareness</li>
                <li>Relationship management</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h5>How is it different to IQ?</h5>
            <p>
                Intelligence quotient (IQ) is a number to express a person's intelligence relative to their
                age. It is a measure of a personâ€™s reasoning ability and how they use logic to
                answer a question or solve a problem. IQ can also be used to define an individual's
                knowledge and proficiency of a specific topic.
            </p>

            <h5>Why is emotional intelligence important?</h5>
            <p>
                EQ is important as it allows you to communicate effectively and work productively
                with others. It also also allows you to adapt to change and challenges when they
                arise more easily.
