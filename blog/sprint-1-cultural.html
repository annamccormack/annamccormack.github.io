            <h5>Describe your core personal values.</h5>
            <p>
                This year has been a year of reflection for me with my plans having to change so much. I
                have
                used this year to take a step back and reflect on my personal values and my goals for the
                future. I would summarize my core personal values as integrity, balance, kindness, purpose,
                and
                growth.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrity is an important part of my identity as I value honesty and staying true to
                    myself.</li>

                <li>It is important to me to treat everyone with kindness and compassion even when I do not
                    agree, I
                    still find it important to try and understand their situation.</li>

                <li>I am always striving to create balance in my life between approaching life with
                    structure vs.
                    being flexible and adapting to changes.</li>

                <li> I highly value having a purpose and making a difference in my own way. I believe that
                    everyone
                    can make a difference in their lifetime no matter how small or big the effect may be.
                </li>

                <li>I value growth, professionally and personally. I have found I get the most joy and
                    engagement
                    out of a job when I can continue to learn and I am being challenged to improve myself
                    and my
                    outcomes.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h5>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed
                up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences
                of the action you took.</h5>

            <p>
                Having worked in the fashion industry which is known as one of the most polluting industries
                in
                the world along with a lot of questionable ethical practices I have spent a lot of time
                researching these issues. With the knowledge of how much of an impact unsustainable and
                unethical fashion has made my decisions when consuming fashion an ethical one. One of the
                big ethical decisions is the choice between the use of leather vs. faux leather shoes.
            </p>
            <p>
                With leather, the pros are that it is a long-lasting and hard-wearing product that will last
                a long time plus it is a by-product of the meat industry and will eventually decompose. The
                cons are that most leather is tanned using high levels of toxic chemicals, there is
                potential
                animal cruelty in the supply chain and the leather trade is contributing to the
                deforestation of
                theamazon.
            </p>
            <p>
                But then we look at the alternative which is faux leather which is a plastic-based synthetic
                material. The pros are that there is no animal cruelty involved in the supply chain, and it
                is durable. The cons are that it is another plastic product which will not decompose, and
                also contains harmful chemicals.
            </p>
            <p>
                So how do I decide between real and faux leather after knowing all the facts?
                My decision is only to buy leather if I am sourcing my shoes from a company who is doing
                their best to minimise their impact. For example, some companies are choosing to use
                vegetable tanning, who are ensuring that they do not contribute to deforestation and are
                ethically
                sourced. So when I do decide to buy a leather product I do my research and I make sure that
                I care for my shoes so they last for as long as possible.
            </p>
            <h5>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h5>
            <p>
                I find it hard to pinpoint exactly how my culture has influenced my values and identity as a
                Pakeha New Zealander. However, my values and identity have been strongly influenced by my
                family. I grew up with my mum teaching music in the house along with my dad working at home
                as
                an Architect. I believe being surrounded by this creativity and having a front-row seat into
                my
                parents' careers has given me the understanding of hard work, adaptability and a willingness
                to
                follow a career path that is less traditional and to instead find a path that I am
                passionate
                about, that makes me feel like I can make a difference.
            </p>

            <h5>Describe your strengths and limitations.</h5>
            <p>
                My strengths are that I am a hard worker, I am flexible, I bring a creative mindset to my
                work,
                I am a team player and I am always open to new experiences and learning new skills. My
                limitations are that I am quite self-critical and a bit of a perfectionist which can prevent
                me
                from moving on from a task or result in spending too much time on the little details. I also
                need to work having confidence in my ideas and communicating my ideas and work to others
                effectively.
            </p>

            <h5>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.
            </h5>
            <p>
                My flexibility, my willingness to give any task a try or help anyone else out has been an
                asset
                to my previous career in fashion and will be something I bring into my new career path.
                I have found that my desire to be learning new skills and having variety in my work has
                resulted
                in outgrowing my roles but I have been held back being self-critical and having a lack of
                opportunities in the industry. Being very self-critical and trying to perfect my work has
                gotten
                in the way of my learning in the past.
            </p>

            <h5>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might
                intersect with learning obstacles.</h5>
            <p>
                I believe all my strengths will aid me in succeeding in my learning journey at EDA. I can
                use
                my
                flexibility, perseverance and creative mindset to overcome obstacles and problem solve.
                Being a
                team player will be helpful while completing group tasks. The obstacles I will encounter
                will be
                self-doubt and self-criticism which might tell me my work isn't good enough or I won't be
                smart
                enough to complete the bootcamp and become a web developer.
            </p>

            <h5>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with
                others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time,
                how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now,
                and why.</h5>

            <p>
                I was working in a team and we had a deadline to meet. Each team member had tasks to
                complete
                along the chain. I had completed as much work as I could and was awaiting more work from a
                colleague who had a lot of work to do and was overwhelmed. I offered to help in any way I
                could,
                however, they declined. This resistance my colleague had to give up control of their work by
                allowing me to help was frustrating as I could have easily helped to lighten my colleagues'
                workload and ultimately meet our deadline sooner. The way I dealt with this situation was by
                waiting to approach my colleague when they were not in a position of stress. I then asked to
                be
                shown how they complete their tasks. This meant the next time we needed to meet a deadline I
                was
                able to offer my colleague help, my colleague felt comfortable in sharing their work, and we
                were more productive as a team.
