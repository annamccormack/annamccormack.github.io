            <h5>A time when I got blocked on a simple problem.</h5>
            <p>
                During the Built-in Methods kata, I found I got stuck on the deBee function. I had written
                my pseudocode for the function and researched what in-built methods I needed to use, but all
                my failed attempts kept on telling me that the .find method did not exist. With some
                googling, and trying the rubber ducky method by talking to my fern plant, I figured how to
                combine all the in-built methods correctly. Yet, the function was still not passing the
                tests! Why?! I had simply forgotten to include the brackets ( ) at the end of the
                .toLowerCase() method. This challenge taught me the importance of checking for spelling and
                syntax mistakes and using the error messages to help me solve the problem.
            </p>
            <h5>A time when I solved a problem in an elegant way</h5>
            <p>
                During the kata challenges this week, I felt like I was able to solve the JS Olympics
                challenges quite elegantly. I was on a roll from all the previous kata challenges and
                felt quite confident in my problem-solving abilities after successfully working
                through all the previous problems. I learnt that using pseudocode is a helpful tool
                for planning my solution before writing any code.
            </p>
            <h5>Reflecting on my confidence in using problem-solving techniques and processes.</h5>
            <br>
            <h6>Pseudocode</h6>
            <p>
                Is not actual code, but is non-technical steps, written plainly that create the rough draft
                of your code. I have found pseudocode a very important step in my problem-solving process,
                and one of the first steps I take when planning my code. It allows me to break down the
                large challenge into smaller manageable tasks and to have a greater understanding of what my
                code will do.
            </p>
            <h6>Trying something</h6>
            <p>
                By simply attempting something you have started to solve the problem because if it works
                then great and if it doesn't then it is a starting point from where you can apply other
                problem-solving techniques. By giving the code a try you will get error messages that may
                help you figure out what you have done wrong and may lead to questions that can be answered
                by researching further.
            </p>
            <h6>Reading error messages</h6>
            <p>
                When an error occurs, JavaScript will normally stop, and generate an error message. Reading
                these error messages can be a very useful way to debug your code. The error message provides
                the location/ line of the error and the type of error. Some examples of errors messages
                include Syntax errors, Expected or unexpected parenthesis and brackets, X Is Not defined:
                when a variable has not been defined. I have found reading through error messages great at
                pinpointing why my code is not working.
            </p>
            <h6>The Rubber Ducky Method</h6>
            <p>
                Is a method of debugging code. It involves explaining the problem to an inanimate object
                like a rubber duck. Typically in the process of doing this, youâ€™ll find your problem.
                <!-- (insert meme)  -->
                I don't have a rubber duck but I have tried discussing my problems out loud to my
                houseplants. I do feel a little silly and have had mixed results from this technique.
            </p>
            <h6>Console logging</h6>
            <p>
                console.log() is a function that writes a message to log on the console. This is a useful
                way to test sections of code to see if they are functioning.
            </p>
            <h6>Googling</h6>
            <p>
                Google is a great tool as it can provide you with the knowledge you need. Any problem you
                have when coding, someone else has had before or has the answer. Keeping to concise and
                simple questions when googling can find these answers quickly. I found myself using google a
                lot during the kata challenges, for finding out about methods or getting past a problem,
                googling has been a very helpful tool.
            </p>
            <h6>Asking your peers and coaches for help</h6>
            <p>
                I haven't had any many instances during the foundations of needing to ask for help from
                peers or coaches but when I do need that help I am comfortable to do so.
            </p>
            <h6>Reflection</h6>
            <p class="quote">
                "We do not learn from experience ... we learn from reflecting on experience." | John Dewey
            </p>
            <p>
                I have found using reflection as a great way to improve my process. Reflecting at the end of
                a task means I understand what I have learnt and ensures I have met the learning
                competencies and identifies areas I may need to work on.
                I have gotten into the habit of starting each day of study with these four questions:
            </p>
            <ul class="reflection">
                <li>What are my goals today?</li>
                <li>What are my challenges today?</li>
                <li>Have I reached my goals for today?</li>
                <li>What have I learnt today?</li>
            </ul>
